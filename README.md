# Shopit
Shop It! is a cloud based mobile application for enhancing the shopping
experience for users on the go. Our application can recommend best offers in
nearby stores, deals in restaurants and best discounts on products based on
your location. Project uses highly scalable and efficient Amazon services like SQS
and SNS for ensuring high availability. For notifications, we have used Google
Cloud Messaging (GCM) for real time service. We are using REST API for
providing responses from backend Elasticsearch engine scanning through high
amount of geocoded deals data ensuring minimum response time for users.
With this application users now have a power to reach beyond just an
conventional shopping application. By registering as a merchant in the app and
user can start own business or boost an existing one.
